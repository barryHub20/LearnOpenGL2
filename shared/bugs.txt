Fix for Android:
-not using OpenGL ES 3.0
	-FIXED: specify in shader to use opengl es 3.0
-use c string for log function input
-LoadMaterial() called multiple times
	-seems to be a false alarm
TexCoord doesn't seem to be working
	-use layout specifier in vertex shader
MAT_FLOOR_TILES work but MAT_WOODEN_CRATE doesn't
	-png doesn't seem to work
	-FIXED: glTexImage2D param 3 for png types pls specify GL_RGBA instead of GL_RGB
Specular not working, seems like POW with shininess portion giving weird output
	-material.shininess is 0.0 on Android, seems like there are issues with float uniforms
	-FIXED: float uniform cannot be in a struct, moved to standalone float
Specular light appears blocky
	-set fragment shader to use highdp float

Fix for Windows:
-mem. leak detected!!
	-for now assume it's false positives (it can happen). The detected leaks are determined to be listed after 
	all the code in main()

For both:
-OSEngine and other singletons to use static vars for instance
